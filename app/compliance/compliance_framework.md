## 1. FINRA Rule 2210 — Communications with the Public
### [PRIMARY — FULL RULE TEXT]

**Why this applies:** Francisco Covarrubias and Juliana Soto are registered representatives through Finalis Securities LLC (FINRA/SIPC member). Any newsletter distributed to their contact list constitutes a "retail communication" under Rule 2210 — a written electronic communication distributed to more than 25 retail investors within a 30-day period. This triggers the strictest content standards, approval requirements, and recordkeeping obligations.

---

### (a) Definitions

For purposes of this Rule and any interpretation thereof:

(1) "Communications" consist of correspondence, retail communications and institutional communications.

(2) "Correspondence" means any written (including electronic) communication that is distributed or made available to 25 or fewer retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period.

(3) "Institutional communication" means any written (including electronic) communication that is distributed or made available only to institutional investors, but does not include a member's internal communications.

(4) "Institutional investor" means any:

(A) person described in Rule 4512(c), regardless of whether the person has an account with a member;
(B) governmental entity or subdivision thereof;
(C) employee benefit plan, or multiple employee benefit plans offered to employees of the same employer, that meet the requirements of Section 403(b) or Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code and in the aggregate have at least 100 participants, but does not include any participant of such plans;
(D) qualified plan, as defined in Section 3(a)(12)(C) of the Exchange Act, or multiple qualified plans offered to employees of the same employer, that in the aggregate have at least 100 participants, but does not include any participant of such plans;
(E) member or registered person of such a member; and
(F) person acting solely on behalf of any such institutional investor.

No member may treat a communication as having been distributed to an institutional investor if the member has reason to believe that the communication or any excerpt thereof will be forwarded or made available to any retail investor.

(5) "Retail communication" means any written (including electronic) communication that is distributed or made available to more than 25 retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period.

(6) "Retail investor" means any person other than an institutional investor, regardless of whether the person has an account with a member.

(7) "Covered investment fund research report" has the meaning given that term in paragraph (c)(3) of Securities Act Rule 139b.

### (b) Approval, Review and Recordkeeping

**(1) Retail Communications**

(A) An appropriately qualified registered principal of the member must approve each retail communication before the earlier of its use or filing with FINRA's Advertising Regulation Department ("Department").

(B) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(A) may be met by a Supervisory Analyst approved pursuant to Rule 1220(a)(14) with respect to: (i) research reports on debt and equity securities as described in Rules 2241(a)(11) and 2242(a)(3); (ii) retail communications as described in Rules 2241(a)(11)(A) and 2242(a)(3)(A); and (iii) other research communications, provided that the Supervisory Analyst has technical expertise in the particular product area. A Supervisory Analyst may not approve a retail communication that requires a separate registration unless the Supervisory Analyst also has such other registration.

(C) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(A) shall not apply with regard to any retail communication if, at the time that a member intends to publish or distribute it:

(i) another member has filed it with the Department and has received a letter from the Department stating that it appears to be consistent with applicable standards; and
(ii) the member using it in reliance upon this subparagraph has not materially altered it and will not use it in a manner that is inconsistent with the conditions of the Department's letter.

(D) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(A) shall not apply with regard to the following retail communications, provided that the member supervises and reviews such communications in the same manner as required for supervising and reviewing correspondence pursuant to Rules 3110(b) and 3110.06 through .09:

(i) any retail communication that is excepted from the definition of "research report" pursuant to Rule 2241(a)(11)(A) or "debt research report" under Rule 2242(a)(3)(A), unless the communication makes any financial or investment recommendation;
(ii) any retail communication that is posted on an online interactive electronic forum; and
(iii) any retail communication that does not make any financial or investment recommendation or otherwise promote a product or service of the member.

(E) Pursuant to the Rule 9600 Series, FINRA may conditionally or unconditionally grant an exemption from paragraph (b)(1)(A) for good cause shown after taking into consideration all relevant factors, to the extent such exemption is consistent with the purposes of the Rule, the protection of investors, and the public interest.

(F) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Rule, an appropriately qualified principal must approve a communication prior to a member filing the communication with the Department.

**(2) Correspondence**

All correspondence is subject to the supervision and review requirements of Rules 3110(b) and 3110.06 through .09.

**(3) Institutional Communications**

Each member shall establish written procedures that are appropriate to its business, size, structure, and customers for the review by an appropriately qualified registered principal of institutional communications used by the member and its associated persons. Such procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that institutional communications comply with applicable standards. When such procedures do not require review of all institutional communications prior to first use or distribution, they must include provision for the education and training of associated persons as to the firm's procedures governing institutional communications, documentation of such education and training, and surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to. Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must be maintained and made available to FINRA upon request.

**(4) Recordkeeping**

(A) Members must maintain all retail communications and institutional communications for the retention period required by SEA Rule 17a-4(b) and in a format and media that comply with SEA Rule 17a-4. The records must include:

(i) a copy of the communication and the dates of first and (if applicable) last use of such communication;
(ii) the name of any registered principal who approved the communication and the date that approval was given;
(iii) in the case of a retail communication or an institutional communication that is not approved prior to first use by a registered principal, the name of the person who prepared or distributed the communication;
(iv) information concerning the source of any statistical table, chart, graph or other illustration used in the communication;
(v) for any retail communication for which principal approval is not required pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(C), the name of the member that filed the retail communication with the Department, and a copy of the corresponding review letter from the Department; and
(vi) for any retail communication that includes or incorporates a performance ranking or performance comparison of a registered investment company, a copy of the ranking or performance used in the retail communication.

(B) Members must maintain all correspondence in accordance with the record-keeping requirements of Rules 3110.09 and 4511.

### (c) Filing Requirements and Review Procedures

**(1) Requirement for Certain Members to File Retail Communications Prior to First Use**

(A) For a period of one year beginning on the date reflected in the Central Registration Depository (CRD®) system as the date that FINRA membership became effective, the member must file with the Department at least 10 business days prior to first use any retail communication that is published or used in any electronic or other public media, including any generally accessible website, newspaper, magazine or other periodical, radio, television, telephone or audio recording, video display, signs or billboards, motion pictures, or telephone directories (other than routine listings). To the extent any retail communication that is subject to this filing requirement is a free writing prospectus that has been filed with the SEC pursuant to Securities Act Rule 433(d)(1)(ii), the member may file such retail communication within 10 business days of first use rather than at least 10 business days prior to first use.

(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Department determines that a member has departed from the standards of this Rule, it may require that such member file all communications, or the portion of such member's communications that is related to any specific types or classes of securities or services, with the Department at least 10 business days prior to first use. The Department will notify the member in writing of the types of communications to be filed and the length of time such requirement is to be in effect. Any filing requirement imposed under this subparagraph will take effect 21 calendar days after service of the written notice, during which time the member may request a hearing under Rules 9551 and 9559.

Such filings must include a copy of the data on which the ranking or comparison is based.

(B) Retail communications concerning security futures. The requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(B) shall not be applicable to:

**(4) Filing of Television or Video Retail Communications**

**(6) Spot-Check Procedures**

In addition to the foregoing requirements, each member's written (including electronic) communications may be subject to a spot-check procedure. Upon written request from the Department, each member must submit the material requested in a spot-check procedure within the time frame specified by the Department.

**(7) Exclusions from Filing Requirements**

The following communications are excluded from the filing requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4):

(G) Retail communications prepared in accordance with Section 2(a)(10)(b) of the Securities Act, as amended, or any rule thereunder, such as Rule 134, and announcements as a matter of record that a member has participated in a private placement, unless the retail communications are related to publicly offered direct participation programs or securities issued by registered investment companies.

### (d) Content Standards

> **⚠️ THIS IS THE SECTION MOST CRITICAL FOR THE COMPLIANCE ENGINE. Every draft must be checked against these standards.**

**(1) General Standards**

**(A) FAIR AND BALANCED:** All member communications must be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith, must be fair and balanced, and must provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts in regard to any particular security or type of security, industry, or service. No member may omit any material fact or qualification if the omission, in light of the context of the material presented, would cause the communications to be misleading.

**(B) NO FALSE/MISLEADING STATEMENTS:** No member may make any false, exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory or misleading statement or claim in any communication. No member may publish, circulate or distribute any communication that the member knows or has reason to know contains any untrue statement of a material fact or is otherwise false or misleading.

**(C) LEGENDS/FOOTNOTES:** Information may be placed in a legend or footnote only in the event that such placement would not inhibit an investor's understanding of the communication.

**(D) BALANCED RISK/BENEFIT:** Members must ensure that statements are clear and not misleading within the context in which they are made, and that they provide balanced treatment of risks and potential benefits. Communications must be consistent with the risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainty of dividends, rates of return and yield inherent to investments.

**(E) AUDIENCE-APPROPRIATE:** Members must consider the nature of the audience to which the communication will be directed and must provide details and explanations appropriate to the audience.

**(F) NO PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS:** Communications may not predict or project performance, imply that past performance will recur or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast; provided, however, that this paragraph (d)(1)(F) does not prohibit:

(i) A hypothetical illustration of mathematical principles, provided that it does not predict or project the performance of an investment or investment strategy;
(ii) An investment analysis tool, or a written report produced by an investment analysis tool, that meets the requirements of Rule 2214; and
(iii) A price target contained in a research report on debt or equity securities, provided that the price target has a reasonable basis, the report discloses the valuation methods used to determine the price target, and the price target is accompanied by disclosure concerning the risks that may impede achievement of the price target.

**(2) Comparisons**

Any comparison in retail communications between investments or services must disclose all material differences between them, including (as applicable) investment objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, safety, guarantees or insurance, fluctuation of principal or return, and tax features.

**(3) Disclosure of Member's Name**

All retail communications and correspondence must:

(A) prominently disclose the name of the member, or the name under which the member's broker-dealer business primarily is conducted as disclosed on the member's Form BD, and may also include a fictional name by which the member is commonly recognized or which is required by any state or jurisdiction;
(B) reflect any relationship between the member and any non-member or individual who is also named; and
(C) if it includes other names, reflect which products or services are being offered by the member.

**(4) Tax Considerations**

(A) In retail communications and correspondence, references to tax-free or tax-exempt income must indicate which income taxes apply, or which do not, unless income is free from all applicable taxes.
(B) Communications may not characterize income or investment returns as tax-free or exempt from income tax when tax liability is merely postponed or deferred, such as when taxes are payable upon redemption.

**(5) Disclosure of Fees, Expenses and Standardized Performance**

(A) Retail communications and correspondence that present non-money market fund open-end management investment company performance data as permitted by Securities Act Rule 482 and Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act must disclose: (i) the standardized performance information mandated by Securities Act Rule 482 and Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act; and (ii) to the extent applicable: a. the maximum sales charge imposed on purchases or the maximum deferred sales charge; and b. the total annual fund operating expense ratio, gross of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements.

**(6) Testimonials**

(A) If any testimonial in a communication concerns a technical aspect of investing, the person making the testimonial must have the knowledge and experience to form a valid opinion.
(B) Retail communications or correspondence providing any testimonial concerning the investment advice or investment performance of a member or its products must prominently disclose: (i) The fact that the testimonial may not be representative of the experience of other customers. (ii) The fact that the testimonial is no guarantee of future performance or success. (iii) If more than $100 in value is paid for the testimonial, the fact that it is a paid testimonial.

**(7) Recommendations**

(A) Retail communications that include a recommendation of securities must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation and must disclose, if applicable: (i) that the member was making a market in the security being recommended; (ii) that the member or any associated person has a financial interest in any of the securities of the issuer whose securities are recommended; and (iii) that the member was manager or co-manager of a public offering of any securities of the issuer whose securities are recommended within the past 12 months.

(C) A retail communication or correspondence may not refer, directly or indirectly, to past specific recommendations of the member that were or would have been profitable to any person.

### (e) Limitations on Use of FINRA's Name

Members may indicate FINRA membership in conformity with Article XV, Section 2 of the FINRA By-Laws provided the communication neither states nor implies that FINRA, or any other corporate name or facility owned by FINRA, endorses, indemnifies, or guarantees the member's business practices, selling methods, the class or type of securities offered, or any specific security.

### (f) Public Appearances

(1) When sponsoring or participating in a seminar, forum, radio or television interview, or when otherwise engaged in public appearances or speaking activities that are unscripted and do not constitute retail communications, institutional communications or correspondence ("public appearance"), persons associated with members must follow the standards of paragraph (d)(1).

(4) Any scripts, slides, handouts or other written (including electronic) materials used in connection with public appearances are considered communications for purposes of this Rule.

### (g) Violation of Other Rules

Any violation by a member of any rule of the SEC, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board applicable to member communications will be deemed a violation of this Rule 2210.

## 2. SEC Regulation D — Private Placement Rules
### [SUPPORTING — SUMMARY]

**Why this applies:** The Find Capital acts as a placement agent for fund managers raising capital through private placements. Newsletter content that references specific offerings, fund closings, or fundraising activity must avoid crossing into general solicitation territory.

### Key Provisions Relevant to Newsletter Compliance

**Rule 506(b) — No General Solicitation:**
- Securities may be sold to unlimited accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited sophisticated investors
- NO general solicitation or general advertising permitted
- Newsletter content discussing specific fund offerings the firm is involved with could be construed as general solicitation
- **Compliance check:** Flag any content that could be interpreted as promoting a specific offering The Find is advising on

**Rule 506(c) — General Solicitation Permitted (with restrictions):**
- Allows general solicitation but ALL purchasers must be accredited investors
- Issuer must take "reasonable steps" to verify accredited investor status
- Even under 506(c), promotional content must not contain material misstatements or omissions

**Accredited Investor Definition (relevant for audience awareness):**
- Individual: $200K+ income ($300K with spouse) for past 2 years, or $1M+ net worth excluding primary residence
- Entity: $5M+ in assets, or all equity owners are accredited investors
- Institutional: banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, employee benefit plans with $5M+ in assets

**Form D Filing Requirement:**
- Issuers must file Form D with SEC within 15 days of first sale
- Newsletter should not reference deals before Form D is filed

### What the Compliance Engine Checks

- **BLOCK:** Any content that promotes a specific offering The Find is advising on (general solicitation risk)
- **WARNING:** References to specific fund closings where The Find acted as placement agent (disclosure requirements may apply)
- **WARNING:** Any content that could blur the line between market commentary and offering promotion
- **ADD_DISCLAIMER:** When discussing private placements generally, note that "Private placements are subject to significant risks including illiquidity and loss of principal."

## 3. CFIUS — Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
### [SUPPORTING — SUMMARY]

**Why this applies:** The Find Capital operates at the intersection of cross-border capital flows — GCC sovereign wealth, LATAM institutional capital, and US real estate. CFIUS reviews foreign investment in US real estate near sensitive sites. Newsletter content covering cross-border deals should demonstrate awareness of this regulatory dimension.

### Key Provisions Relevant to Newsletter Content

**What CFIUS Does:**
- Interagency committee that reviews foreign investment in US businesses and real estate for national security implications
- Authorized under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA)
- Can review purchase, lease, or concession of real estate by foreign persons near sensitive government/military sites

**Real Estate Jurisdiction (31 CFR Part 802):**
- Covers real estate within specified distances of ~280 military installations and sensitive government sites
- Applies to purchases, leases, and concessions by foreign persons
- Notification is voluntary but strongly encouraged
- CFIUS can unwind completed transactions (as demonstrated in the MineOne/Wyoming case, 2024)
- November 2024 final rule added 59 new military installations to the review list

**Excepted Transactions:**
- Housing units, urbanized areas/urban clusters (as defined by Census Bureau)
- Most commercial office space, retail, accommodation, food service
- Investors from "excepted foreign states" (currently: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK — notably NOT GCC countries)

**Known Investor Program (February 2026):**
- New framework for frequent filers to receive expedited review
- Requires 3+ filings in past 3 years, clean compliance history
- Signals CFIUS's intent to streamline while maintaining rigor

### What the Compliance Engine Checks

- **WARNING:** When discussing GCC or other non-excepted foreign investment in US real estate near military/sensitive sites, ensure balanced coverage of CFIUS review requirements
- **ADD_DISCLAIMER:** Cross-border real estate transactions may be subject to CFIUS review — note this when discussing foreign capital flows into US real estate
- **WARNING:** Do not suggest that CFIUS review is a formality or that certain transactions are immune from review
- **FLAG:** Any content suggesting ways to structure transactions to avoid CFIUS jurisdiction

---

## 4. SEC Marketing Rule — Rule 206(4)-1
### [SUPPORTING — SUMMARY]

**Why this applies:** While The Find Capital operates through Finalis Securities (broker-dealer) rather than as a registered investment adviser, this rule is relevant because: (a) the newsletter could be construed as marketing material for advisory services, (b) the principles overlap significantly with FINRA 2210, and (c) if The Find ever registers as an investment adviser, this rule applies directly. Best practice is to comply proactively.

### Key Principles (Seven General Prohibitions)

An advertisement may NOT include:

1. **Untrue statements of material fact** — or omit material facts necessary to make statements not misleading
2. **Unsubstantiated material claims** — statements of material fact that the adviser cannot substantiate upon demand
3. **Untrue/misleading implications** — statements that are technically true but create a misleading impression
4. **Cherry-picked performance** — discussing specific profitable investments without fair context for all investments in the same category
5. **Misleading performance presentation** — presenting performance results that are not fair and balanced
6. **More likely to mislead than inform** — anything that would reasonably be expected to mislead rather than inform
7. **Otherwise materially misleading** — catch-all for any content that is misleading in light of all circumstances

### Performance Advertising Requirements

- If showing gross performance, must also show net performance with equal prominence
- Must show 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year returns (or since inception if shorter)
- Cannot cherry-pick favorable time periods
- Hypothetical performance requires additional disclosures and policies

### Testimonials and Endorsements

- Permitted with disclosure of: (a) whether person is a client, (b) whether person is compensated
- Must disclose conflicts of interest
- Written agreement required with compensated promoters
- Bad actor disqualification provisions apply

### What the Compliance Engine Checks

- **WARNING:** Any content that could be construed as a testimonial or endorsement without proper disclosure
- **WARNING:** Selective presentation of performance data (cherry-picking favorable periods or metrics)
- **BLOCK:** Unsubstantiated material claims about investment performance or outcomes
- **ADD_DISCLAIMER:** When discussing performance metrics, ensure source attribution and appropriate disclaimers

## 5. FINRA Rule 2010 — Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade
### [SUPPORTING — SUMMARY]

**Why this applies:** Rule 2010 is the ethical conduct catch-all that FINRA cites alongside 2210 in enforcement actions. It requires members to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. Newsletter content that is technically compliant with 2210 could still violate 2010 if it is deceptive, unfair, or unethical in spirit.

### Full Rule Text

> "A member, in the conduct of its business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade."

### How This Applies to Newsletter Content

This rule is intentionally broad and principles-based. FINRA uses it as a supplementary enforcement tool when conduct falls outside the specific prohibitions of other rules but still violates the spirit of fair dealing. For newsletter compliance:

- Content that is technically accurate but structured to mislead (e.g., citing only favorable data, omitting context) could violate Rule 2010 even if it passes Rule 2210 checks
- Recommendations or commentary that serve the firm's interests over the reader's interests
- Any content that a reasonable person would consider inconsistent with ethical business conduct

### What the Compliance Engine Checks

- **WARNING:** Content that may be technically accurate but appears designed to mislead through selective framing
- **WARNING:** Any implicit self-promotion that prioritizes firm interests over reader value
- This is evaluated in the LLM compliance pass (Pass 2) as a holistic tone/ethics review
